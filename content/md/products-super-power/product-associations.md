# Overview

A product may be associated with none or several other products or product groups. This type of link has a direction: 1-way or 2-way. Please read our [Association Types documentation](manage-your-association-types.html#Overview) for more information.

These types of associations enable you to define relationships, such as an alternative product, a substitution between products, a cross-sell/up-sell option or even a product set composed of different quantities of products.

# View the productâ€™s associations

To check the association types:
1.  Open the relevant product edit form
1.  Click on the `Associations` tab
1.  Click on the association type name on the left-hand side
1.  Click on the `Show groups` button on the right-hand side of the tab to display the product groups grid
1.  Click on the `Show products` button on the right-hand side of the tab to display the product grid

:::info
You can define associations on [product models](what-about-products-variants.html#what-is-a-product-model), please refer to this [article](enrich-products-variants.html#associate) for more details.
:::

Only the associated products or [product models](what-about-products-variants.html#what-is-a-product-model) are displayed in the `Associations` tab.

![View the associated products](../img/Products_ProductsAssociated21.png)

The total number of associations is displayed per product or product model (the figure is visible after the `Associations` tab label) and per association type (figure visible in the `Association type` list).
![View the number of associations](../img/Products_Products_Associated_Figures.png)

By default, if the product has no association for the selected association type, nothing is displayed in the `Associations` tab.

# About associations' order

Today, it is not possible to define a specific order of your associated products/product models.
The current order is following the rules after:
* Associated products are first displayed, then associated product models are displayed after.
* Associated products/product models are then ordered by an alphanumerical logic based on their SKU.  

For instance, if you associated the products "4544719001003", "61223" "CHAIR_ROSA_BLUE_2022" and the product model "DINING_SET_3055978276329", the order all those products are displayed will be the following:
1. Product "4544719001003"
1. Product "61223"
1. Product "CHAIR_ROSA_BLUE_2022"
1. Product model "DINING_SET_3055978276329"

1.  Click on the `Confirm` button

  ![View the associated products](../img/Products_ProductsAssociated21.png)

:::info
A product can also be associated to a [product model](what-about-products-variants.html#what-is-a-product-model).
:::

:::warning
If you want to associate your products/product models with 2-way associations via an XLSX/CSV import, please note that the PIM processes the import information line by line. So if different products A & B are associated with a same product C, make sure that the product C is also associated with products A & B, otherwise the associations made on the previous lines will be removed.
:::

:::warning
Please note that you should not associate more than 100 products/product models per one product/product model. If you exceed this number, you might expect performance issues.
:::

1.  Open the product form
1.  Click on the `Associations` tab
1.  Select the association type with quantities you created (please read our [Association Types](manage-your-association-types.html#create-an-association-type-with-quantities) documentation for more information.)
  ![Select an association type](../img/Products_Products_Associations_Select_Association_type.png)
1.  Click on `Add associations`
1.  The picker to select product or product models opens
  ![Associations products picker](../img/Products_Products_Associations_Picker.png)
1.  Filter on the categories, on the label or identifier or add filters to find the products or product models you want to associate
